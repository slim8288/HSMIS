# HSMIS

The real useful script here is analyzehsmis.py, which contains universal functions that can take the .csv file outputs after ImageJ processing and calculate characteristics about the path and cell size.

All the analysis files (e.g., cope_analysis.py) just record the exact analysis I did for that particular experiment. They have file paths (to the Google Drive) hardcoded in. But maybe a useful tool for figuring out the list comprehensions and statistics for making sense of the data.
